# Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation
A basic Python program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the message by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. You can choose how many positions to shift, and whether to encrypt or decrypt.

# How It Works
Encrypt: Shifts letters forward by a certain number.
Decrypt: Shifts letters backward by the same number to get the original message.
The program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters. Non-alphabet characters (spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.

# How to Use
Clone or download this repository.
Run the script:
  python CaesarCipher.py

# Follow the prompts:
  Choose whether to Encrypt or Decrypt.
  Enter your message.
  Input the shift value (the number of positions to shift).

# Example
Encrypt the message "Hello World" with a shift of 3:
  Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog!
  
Decrypt the message "Khoor Zruog!" with a shift of 3:
  Decrypted message: Hello World!

# Note
This is a basic implementation for learning purposes.
